# DAMA-NorthernVirgina
Welcome to the repository for the Data Management Association of Northern Virginia's (DAMA-NOVA) new website development project. Our mission is to create a comprehensive, user-friendly WordPress site, hosted at https://dama-nova.org.

The project board at https://github.com/orgs/DAMA-NOVA/projects/1/views/1 manages all aspects of development, from configuring hosting settings to ensuring website security. It also tracks content creation, from customizing WordPress themes to setting up key pages (About Us, Events, Membership, Resources) and integrating social media.

We adhere to principles of transparency and collaboration, regularly updating the board with progress reports, identified challenges, solutions, and timeline adjustments. Our ultimate goal is to create an engaging platform that serves as a valuable resource for data management professionals in Northern Virginia and beyond.
